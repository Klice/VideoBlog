This is Django App for creating adult video blog on your site.
Currently is very early ALPHA version, so pay respect to this.

Main idea behind this is to create video blog without hosting video files on server but stream this videos directly from well known adult hosting sites instead.
So for adding video to your blog you need just the URL to video page on video hosting, currently its supports:
 - xhamster.com
 - tube8.com
 - empflix.com
 - vk.com (for now your need to registrate app on vk.com and modify models.py to set appropriate setting)

In TODO list at first place is to add support for pornhub.com and to repo UserScripts from add video to blog directly from sites.
